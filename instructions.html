#### Challenge

The challenge of this workshop it to build a calculator. 
It should accept an operation in a String format: 
		
		"1 + 3"

It should 

* parse the input
* calculate the expression
* return a Result of this operation. A result type represents one of our errors or a success.

*** 

### What to do

Have you [installed](install.html) all the stuff and cloned the [repo](https://github.com/Svetixbot/calculator)?
Check out the project structure. 

![Project structure](project.png)

Each part of this application *Calculator, Result and Parser* has corresponsing suite of tests/specs *CalculatorSpec, ResultSpec, ParserSpec*

Ex 1: [Result](result.html)

* Run the tests for the ResultSpec

		~test-only com.whc.calculator.ResultSpec

	* *It will run the test suite for the ResultSpec in a background*
	* *Any time you change ResultSpec file, sbt will re-run these tests*
	* *To exit this infinite loop of running just press Enter * 		
	
* Start uncommenting property tests, one at a time and fix them.
* Check the comments in a Result file, it will give you some hints.


Ex 2: [Parser](parser.html) 

* Run the tests for ParserSpec the same way you run it for ResultSpec
		~test-only com.whc.calculator.ParserSpec

* Start uncommenting property tests one by one and fixing them
* Check the comments in a Parser file, it may give you some hints

Ex 3: [Calculator](calculator.html). 

* Run the tests for the CalculatorSpec, the same way, really.
* Replace 'ignore' word with 'it', one test at a time.

Ex 4, Advanced: try to implement division operaiton

		8 % 2 should result into Ok(4)

Ex 5, Advanced: try to implemet operations with rational numbers. Feel free to use any separator you like:

		8.2 + 0.8 should result into Ok(9)
