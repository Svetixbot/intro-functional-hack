### Cheat sheet

#### Functions are everywhere!

This is a function which accepts Int as an input and returns String as an output:

		val myFunction: Int => String = (i => i.toString)
		val result = myFunction(1) // Invoke it like this
		result: String = 1 // This will be the result

This is a funciton which accepts another function 'f' as a parameter:

		def map(f: Int => String) = ...

And this is a function which returns another function... It accepts amount of type Money and it returs a function which accepts a tuple (Account, Transaction) and returs a Balance.

		def changeBalance(amount: Money): (Account, Transaction) => Balance		

#### Pattern matching

This is a very powerfull mechanism of checking the value of your variables:

		operation match {
		    case '+' => a + b
		    case '-' => a - b
		    case '*' => a * b
		  }

What does it mean? Well, something like this:

		if (operation == '+') {
			return a + b
		} else if (operation == '-') {
			return a - b
		} else if (operation == '*') {
			return a * b
		}	   

#### Fold, Map, FlatMap

Those functions are very heavily used on all the sequence-type objects like List, Array, Dictionary. 

##### Fold

Simple task, calculate a sum of all the elements in an array.
	
		val nums = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		 
		var sum = 0
		for (n <- nums) {
		  sum += n
		}

Fold is abstracting the iteration process for you by providing a way to pass a function as a parameter. This function will be applied on each element:

		val nums = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		val sum = nums.foldLeft(0) { (total, n) =>
		  total + n
		} 		

#### Map

		val list = List(1,2,3)
		def g(v: Int) = v + 1
		l.map(x => g(x)) == will be resolved into => List(2,3,4)

#### flatmap

It does the same thing as map, but it also flattens the output result.

		val list = List(1,2,3)
		def g(v: Int) = List(v-1, v, v+1)

		l.map(x => g(x)) == will be resolved into => List(List(0,1,2), List(1,2,3), List(2,3,4))

		l.flatmap(x => g(x)) = List(0,1,2,1,2,3,2,3,4)
